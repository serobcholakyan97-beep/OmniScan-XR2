# OmniScan-XR2
OmniScan-XR2: Advanced Geological Survey & 3D Mapping Suite
Overview
OmniScan-XR is a professional-grade, sub-surface 3D mapping ecosystem designed for the iPhone 16 Pro and PlayStation VR2 (PSVR2). By fusing high-frequency sonar telemetry with hardware-accelerated spectral analysis, the system identifies specific mineral densities—such as Gold and Diamonds—and projects them into a real-time, GPS-tagged 3D topographic mesh.

Built for the GitHub Codespaces environment, the system utilizes a high-performance cloud-relay architecture to process complex geological data while maintaining a lightweight footprint on mobile hardware.

🛰️ Key Features
AAA+ Voxel Engine: High-resolution sparse voxel mapping (5cm² precision) for deep-earth visualization.
Spectral Mineral Sonar: Real-time signal isolation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) to detect Gold, Gems, and rare Earth elements.
GPS-Anchored Archiving: Automatic geolocation tagging for every scan, stored in a persistent SQLite3 database.
Cross-Reality Visualization: Exported .obj meshes with vertex coloring for instant AR viewing on iOS or immersive exploration in VR.
Resilient Telemetry Bridge: Low-latency hardware-to-cloud relay with automated packet-loss recovery.
